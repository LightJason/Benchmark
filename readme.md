# Multi-Agent Simulation - Benchmark

This project benchmark contains a full working scenario of [LightJason](http://lightjason.org) multi-agent framework. The scenario description is:


The packages is _automatically generated_.

## Development

On each agent class file a _serial identifier_ must be added with a class property

```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = <an unique long value>;
```
for serializing an agent. The build process will break if the value does not exists. This value can be generated by your IDE.

At the end of the ```pom.xml``` file, you found a section, that is disabled. With this section you can enable the _styleguide checking_ of the source files, so during compile phase the build system checks that your codes follow the LightJason styleguide definition


## Usage

The jar file can be executed directly, with

```
java -jar benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Help

For any help information the option ```-help``` can be set and shows additional information

```
java -jar benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -help
```

### ASL Files Generating

For generating agents (ASL files) the jar can be executed with

```
java -jar benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -create
```

### Simulation Example

First run the ASL generating, after that run the simulation with 

```
java -jar benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -asl DefaultAgent.asl -agents 2 -generator default -steps 5
```

it creates 2 agents based on the ASL script ```DefaultAgent.asl``` with the generator ```default``` and runs the simulation 5 steps.

## Agents

The following agents are generated 

 * ```DefaultAgent.asl```
